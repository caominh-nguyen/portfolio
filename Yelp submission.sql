Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10,000 (primary)
ii. Hours = 1,562 (business_id) 
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1,115 (business_id)
v. Review = 10,000 (primary)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
vii. Photo = 10,000 (primary)
viii. Tip = 3,979 (business_id)
ix. User = 10,000 (primary)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2,780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

	| -8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg |         1339 |
	+------------------------+--------------+	


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
	Use the SQL code below, we can calculate the r_squared of 0.43, which is half way between 0 and 1 . This means 43% of movements in fans can be explained by movements in review_count. Hence, we can conclude that having more review slightly correlate with more fans.

	select
		c*c/d/e as r_squared
	from (
	select
		sum(a*b) as c,
		sum(a*a) as d,
		sum(b*b) as e
	from (
	select
		review_count - avgx as a,
		fans - avgy as b
	from user,(
	select
		avg(review_count) as avgx,
		avg(fans) as avgy
	from user)));
	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: More reviews with the word "love"

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select
		Count(*),
		'hate'
	from review
	where text like 'hate%' or text like '%hate' or text like '%hate%'
	union
	select
		Count(*),
		'love'
	from review
	where text like 'love%' or text like '%love' or text like '%love%';

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	city = Toronto; category = Restaurants

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

	Businesses in the 2-3 star group same similar opening hours, suggesting that they cater to similar customers. 
	The 4-5 star group, on the other hand, has widely different opening hours between them, suggesting they each target a different type of customers. 	

	2-3 star group: typically open from 9-11:00 and close at 21-23:00 everyday of the week (conventional opening hours for restaurants)

	select
		business.name,
		business.city,
		category.category,
		hours.hours
	from (business inner join category on
		business.id = category.business_id)
		inner join hours on
		business.id = hours.business_id
	where (business.stars between 2 and 3) 
		and business.city = 'Toronto' 
		and category.category = 'Restaurants';	

	4-5 star group: open hours vary accross businesses: 
	Sushi Osaka one opens traditional hours (11-23:00); 
	Edulis opens for dinners on Wednesday-Saturday and for lunchs on Sunday; 
	Cabin Fever opens from afternoon to 2am the next day.
	select
		business.name,
		business.city,
		category.category,
		hours.hours
	from (business inner join category on
		business.id = category.business_id)
		inner join hours on
		business.id = hours.business_id
	where (business.stars between 4 and 5) 
		and business.city = 'Toronto' 
		and category.category = 'Restaurants';

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
	Overall, the number of reviews vary between the two groups, but also among businesses in the same group. 
	Both groups have business(s) with less than 10 reviews but also have some with a lot of reviews. 
	However, the 4-5 star group have more reviews on average. 
	2-3 star group:	
	select
		avg(business.review_count) as avg,
		min(business.review_count) as min,
		max(business.review_count) as max,
		sum(business.review_count) as sum
	from (business inner join category on
		business.id = category.business_id)
	where (business.stars between 2 and 3) 
		and business.city = 'Toronto' 
		and category.category = 'Restaurants';

+---------------+-----+-----+-----+
|           avg | min | max | sum |
+---------------+-----+-----+-----+
| 28.6666666667 |   5 |  47 |  86 |
+---------------+-----+-----+-----+

	4-5 star group:	
	select
		avg(business.review_count) as avg,
		min(business.review_count) as min,
		max(business.review_count) as max,
		sum(business.review_count) as sum
	from (business inner join category on
		business.id = category.business_id)
	where (business.stars between 4 and 5) 
		and business.city = 'Toronto' 
		and category.category = 'Restaurants'; 

+------+-----+-----+-----+
|  avg | min | max | sum |
+------+-----+-----+-----+
| 41.2 |   8 |  89 | 206 |
+------+-----+-----+-----+
      

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

		Businesses with similar star ratings tend to stay close to each other (clustering). 
		Clustering can be explained by game theory and specifically by ‚ÄúHotelling‚Äôs Model of Spatial Competition.‚Äù
		In this case, 4-5 star restaurants stay further to the West (longitude < -79.4) and 2-3 star restaurants can be found on the East (longitude > -79.4).

SQL code used for analysis:

	select
		business.latitude,
		business.longitude,
		"4-5" as rating
	from (business inner join category on
		business.id = category.business_id)
	where (business.stars between 4 and 5) 
		and business.city = 'Toronto' 
		and category.category = 'Restaurants'
	union all
	select
		business.latitude,
		business.longitude,
		"2-3"
	from (business inner join category on
		business.id = category.business_id)
	where (business.stars between 2 and 3) 
		and business.city = 'Toronto' 
		and category.category = 'Restaurants';

	+----------+-----------+--------+
	| latitude | longitude | rating |
	+----------+-----------+--------+
	|  43.6809 |  -79.4302 | 4-5    |
	|  43.6553 |  -79.4567 | 4-5    |
	|  43.6452 |  -79.5324 | 4-5    |
	|  43.7766 |  -79.4142 | 4-5    |
	|  43.6419 |  -79.4066 | 4-5    |
	|  43.6546 |  -79.3805 | 2-3    |
	|  43.6614 |   -79.379 | 2-3    |
	|  43.6479 |  -79.3901 | 2-3    |
	+----------+-----------+--------+
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

   There are some attributes that businesses that close do not have, in comparison to businesses that open (Notably BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, RestaurantPriceRange2, BusinessParking and Bike Parking).

	select
		business.is_open,
		attribute.name,
		count(*)
	from business inner join attribute on
		business.id = attribute.business_id
	group by
		business.is_open,
		attribute.name
	order by count(*) desc;

+---------+----------------------------+----------+

+---------+----------------------------+----------+
      
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
Businesses that close have no more than 3 checkins, whereas businesses that open can have upto 17 checkins.


SQL code used for analysis:

select
    business.is_open,
    checkin.count,
    count(checkin.count) as frequency
from business inner join checkin on 
    business.id = checkin.business_id
group by business.is_open, checkin.count         

+---------+-------+-----------+
| is_open | count | frequency |
+---------+-------+-----------+
|       0 |     1 |        10 |
|       0 |     2 |         1 |

+---------+-------+-----------+        	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do: How long does it take, on average, for a user to join the Elite squad since they start yelping.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

	To arrive at the final dataset, we need to find the year that a person starts yelping and the first year that person is an elite.
	To extract the year from the yelping_since column in user, we use strftime function. Then, we use the min function to grab the first a person become elite.
	Finally, we subtract the first yelping year from the first elite year and calculate the average of all the results. 
	Overall, it takes almost 2 years (1.9) to reach elite status.                       
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
	+---------------+
	|      avg_time |
	+---------------+
	| 1.90476190476 |
	+---------------+    

iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

	select  
		avg(first_e_year-first_y_year) as avg_time
	from (
	select 
		user.id as id,
		strftime('%Y',user.yelping_since) as first_y_year,
		min(elite_years.year) as first_e_year
	from user inner join elite_years on
		user.id = elite_years.user_id
	group by user.id);
